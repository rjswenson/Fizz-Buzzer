Fizz-Buzz
=========

Description
-----------

\\_Fizzbuzz.rb_\\

Within this repo are two iterations of fizzbuzz for Ruby.
The first is a simple receive a number, output a **fizz**,
**buzz**, or both.

\\_Fizzbuzz_extend.rb_\\

The extended version takes additional options from console
inputs such as **sivv** which ties to the divisor **7**.  These
are custom and will keep accepting as many key-values as you
choose.  Breaking the cycle is caused by entering **done**.

Todo
----
* Modify loop to more elegant solution
* Possibly compartmentalize more
