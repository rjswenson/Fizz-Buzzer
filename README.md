Fizz-Buzz
=========

Description
-----------

Fizzbuzz.rb
~~~~~~~~~~~
Within this repo are two iterations of fizzbuzz for Ruby.
The first is a simple receive a number, output a *fizz*,
*buzz*, or both.

Fizzbuzz_extend.rb
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The extended version takes additional options from console
inputs such as 'sivv' which ties to the divisor '7'.  These
are custom and will keep accepting as many key-values as you
choose.  Breaking the cycle is caused by entering 'done'.

Todo
----
* Modify loop to more elegant solution
* Possibly compartmentalize more
